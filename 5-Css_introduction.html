    <h1>Olá Meu nome é Bianca</h1>
    <h2>Sou profissional da beleza</h2>
    <p> Hi, my name is Bianca, I'm a fully licensed hairstylist based in Calgary.
        With 10 years of experience in the area of beauty, with one of them being in one of the biggest salons in São Paulo - Brazil. I learned what a differentiated service is, how to provide quality service and how to fulfill wishes, always trying to exceed expectations.
        Consequently, my degree of responsibility with the client increased. 
        More than mastering the technique, I believe that it is important to understand the customer and give a service that matches their needs.
        After so much learning and growth, I'm looking for an environment to put my skills into practice with autonomy.</p>
